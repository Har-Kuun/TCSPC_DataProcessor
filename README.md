# TCSPC_DataProcessor

This program automatically process data collected from most Becker-Hickl time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) instruments.  It adds a time axis to all the data points (bin size specified by user), and normalizes the data.  It can process multiple files simultaneously.

To use, one has to first compile the source code using a Windows-based C compiler.  (I am using Visual Studio.)  Then, drag all the .asc data files generated by the TCSPC program onto the icon of this program.  The output files (ending in .txt) will be generated within the same folder as the .asc data files.

This program was written for the DFK lab at UC Merced, but anyone from anywhere can use and distribute this program freely without any limitations.
